# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

## Description

Given a binary tree, determine if it is **height-balanced**.

A **height-balanced** binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

## Examples

### Example 1

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true
```

Tree structure:
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

### Example 2

```
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false
```

Tree structure:
```
       1
      / \
     2   2
    / \
   3   3
  / \
 4   4
```

### Example 3

```
Input: root = []
Output: true
```

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
